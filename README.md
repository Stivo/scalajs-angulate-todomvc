# scalajs-angulate-todomvc
This is an implementation of the [TodoMVC](http://todomvc.com/) app using [scalajs-angulate](https://github.com/jokade/scalajs-angulate).

The client is an adaptation of the [scalajs-angular-todomvc](https://github.com/greencatsoft/scalajs-angular-todomvc) example written by [Xavier Cho](https://github.com/mysticfall). The server is a simple [akka-http](http://akka.io) application (using a tiny abstraction layer called [surf](https://github.com/jokade/surf)).

## Running the Application
```shell
$ sbt
> run
```
Open `http://localhost:8081` in your browser.
